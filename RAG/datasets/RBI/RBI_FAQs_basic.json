            "answer": "The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that money available now is worth more than the same amount of money available in the future due to its potential earning capacity, provided the rate of interest is positive. ₹100 today may not be equivalent to ₹100 to be received after two years. If money is not invested wisely, it can lose value due to inflation. If the return on an investment of ₹100 is say 5% and the inflation rate is 7%, then the real return is (-2%)! Money has lost value to the extent of ₹2. To compensate for inflation and other factors, financial institutions pay interest if you deposit money and charge interest if you borrow money. It is essential to save and invest in appropriate financial products to earn a rate of return above the rate of inflation to preserve the future value of money."

            "question": "What is risk and return?",
            "answer": "Any investment entails a certain degree of risk. Generally, there is a direct correlation between risk and return. The higher the expected return, the higher the risk (including the possibility of losing the initial investment as well). And lower the return, lower the risk as well. The basic investment principle to be kept in mind while investing or saving in financial products is the risk vs. return trade-off. High expected returns may entail higher risk and the possibility of potential losses. Invest your money wisely! Beware! High and quick return schemes could be risky. Do not chase returns without understanding the risks! Thoroughly check the background and performance of the entity offering the scheme. Read the terms and conditions carefully. Do your study and due diligence before being lured by ‘Too Good To Be True’ schemes of unknown entities!"
